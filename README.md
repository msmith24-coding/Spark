# Spark
Spark is the most electrifying programming language. Here are its most valuable features. 
Once you have finished reading through the features, check out the [examples](https://github.com/msmith24-coding/Spark/blob/master/Examples.md).

## Lightning Bolts
End every statement with a lightning bolt!
```JavaScript
print("Hello, World")ϟ
```

## Declarations

Variable finals cannot be re-assigned, edited, or re-declared globally. 
```JavaScript
var final name = "John"ϟ
```

Variable finals cannot be re-assigned, edited, or re-declared locally. 
```JavaScript
let final name = "John"ϟ
```

Variable variables can be re-assigned, edited, and re-declared globally.
```JavaScript
var var name = "John"ϟ
var var name = 0x4A6F686Eϟ
```

Let variables can be re-assigned and edited locally.
```JavaScript
let var name = "John"ϟ
name = "Jane"ϟ
```

## Error Checking and LSP
To make the experience more enjoyable, spark does not have any form of error checking or LSP.

## Compiling
First, install `sparkc` to your command line. Therefore you need to install the SparkC Installer.
To install the SparkC Installer, you must download and install the Spark-Foundation Installer Installer. 

Compiling can be run like this:
```
$ sparkc foo.spark
```

By default, `sparkc` will use 499 volts of electricity as anything 500 volts or above is considered "High Voltage."  

To allow for customizability, `sparkc` has many compiler flags that can be run to modify the experience.

```
$ sparkc -c                             | Only outputs the raw binary before they are linked.
$ sparkc -d <device_id>                 | Allows to select a device the compiler will use.
$ sparkc -d <device0, device1>          | Allows to select multiple devices.
$ sparkc -o <file_name>                 | The name of the file the compiler will produce.
$ sparkc -v <100-4294967296>            | Modifies the number of volts the compiler will provide as punishment.
```
